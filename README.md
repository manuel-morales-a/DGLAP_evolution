# DGLAP-Evolution
This is the code I created to obtain the evolution of parton distribution functions (PDFs) between different energy scales. 
The physical foundations of the project can be found in the paper of "Parton distributions for the LHC" by A. D. Martin, W.J. Stirling, 
R. S. Thorne, and G. Watt (arXiv:0901.0002).
